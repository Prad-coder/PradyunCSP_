    "1. ## Beneficial and Harmful Effects üåç\n",
    "- **Tech impacts society**: Can be both positive (education, health, communication) and negative (privacy loss, job automation, misinformation).\n",
    "- **Ethical dilemmas**: Automated decision-making (e.g., self-driving cars) raises moral questions.\n",
    "- **Environmental cost**: Tech consumes energy; AI models can have large carbon footprints.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. ## The Digital Divide üåê\n",
    "- **Access inequality**: Based on income, geography, language, etc.\n",
    "- **Local/global issue**: Exists in both developing and developed regions.\n",
    "- **Solutions**: Government funding, nonprofit outreach, community Wi-Fi, refurbished tech donations.\n",

    "3. ## Computing Bias ‚öñÔ∏è\n",
    "- **Source of bias**: Comes from biased data, human assumptions, or lack of diversity in training sets.\n",
    "- **Consequences**: Inaccurate or unfair systems (e.g., hiring, facial recognition).\n",
    "- **Fixing bias**: Address during:\n",
    "  - **Pre-processing**: Balance datasets\n",
    "  - **In-processing**: Adjust model behavior\n",

    "4. ## Crowdsourcing ü§ù\n",
    "- **Definition**: Gathering help/data from large groups of people (often online).\n",
    "- **Examples**: Wikipedia, Zooniverse, Duolingo, Kickstarter.\n",
    "- **Benefits**:\n",
    "  - Fast data collection\n",
    "  - Community involvement\n",
    "  - Scalable problem-solving\n",
    "- **Distributed computing**: Using many devices to solve large problems (e.g., SETI@home).\n",
