    "1. **\"Is this number divisible by 2?\"**  \n",
    "   **Answer:** Decidable  \n",
    "   **Reason:** This is a simple mathematical operation. You can easily determine if a number is divisible by 2 by checking if it’s even (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"Will this program stop or run forever?\"**  \n",
    "   **Answer:** Undecidable  \n",
    "   **Reason:** This is the Halting Problem, proven by Turing. There is no algorithm that can universally predict if a program will halt or run forever for all possible programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"Does this sentence contain the word 'banana'?\"**  \n",
    "   **Answer:** Decidable  \n",
    "   **Reason:** This is a straightforward string search. You can use algorithms like `find()` or regular expressions to check if the word 'banana' exists in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **\"Will this AI ever become sentient?\"**  \n",
    "   **Answer:** Undecidable  \n",
    "   **Reason:** Predicting if an AI will become sentient is a philosophical and scientific question with no clear, universally applicable answer, making it undecidable.\n",

    "   **Step 2:** If the number is even, say \"Yes.\" If not, say \"No.\"  \n",

    "   **Reason:** This is a simple check for evenness, which can be done in constant time using the modulus operation.\n",

    "2. **Step 1:** Input any program  \n",
    "   **Step 2:** Predict if it will ever stop running  \n",
    "   **Step 3:** Output \"Yes\" if it will stop, \"No\" if it will run forever  \n",
    "   **Answer:** Undecidable  \n",
    "   **Reason:** This is a direct representation of the Halting Problem, which is undecidable because there is no general algorithm that can predict whether all programs halt.\n",

    "### Part 3: Real-Life Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Deciding if a new business venture will succeed.  \n",
    "**Reason:** You can’t be sure if a business will succeed unless you go through the entire process, as there are too many unpredictable factors such as market conditions, competition, and customer behavior.\n",

    "### How did changing the order of coins affect the result?\n",
    "Changing the order of coins can affect the result in some cases. The greedy algorithm always selects the largest coin available, so if you change the order of the coins, it will prioritize different coins. For example, if you use the smaller coins first, the algorithm might need more coins to make the total amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which algorithm used fewer coins?\n",
    "The algorithm using the coins ordered from largest to smallest will usually use fewer coins, as it maximizes the value taken at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where might greedy algorithms work well? Where might they fail?\n",
    "Greedy algorithms work well when making locally optimal choices leads to a globally optimal solution, such as in the case of coin change when the denominations are a set of standard coins like 25¢, 10¢, 5¢, and 1¢. However, they fail in situations where a more complex combination of smaller coins might lead to a better solution (e.g., when the denominations are non-standard).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is one thing you changed, and what did it show you?\n",
    "Changing the order of coins from largest to smallest vs. smallest to largest showed me that the greedy algorithm always takes the largest coin first, but this doesn’t guarantee the minimum number of coins in all cases (though it works fine for standard U.S. coin denominations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2-3 Sentence Summary:\n",
    "Greedy algorithms can provide an efficient solution for coin change problems when the coin denominations lead to locally optimal choices that also result in a globally optimal solution. However, changing the order of coins can impact the outcome, and greedy algorithms may not always produce the fewest coins when the denominations are non-standard. This highlights the importance of choosing the right algorithm for the problem at hand.\n",
