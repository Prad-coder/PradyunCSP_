    "1. ## Binary Search Algorithm üîç\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Quickly find an item in a sorted list.\n",
    "- **Steps**:\n",
    "  - Check middle\n",
    "  - If target < middle, search left half\n",
    "  - If target > middle, search right half\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: O(log n) ‚Äî faster than linear search\n",
    "- **Requirements**: List must be sorted beforehand\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ## Lists and Filtering Algorithms üìã\n",
    "- **Lists**: Variables that hold multiple items (arrays).\n",
    "- **Operations**:\n",
    "  - **Create**: list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  - **Access**: list[0]\n",
    "  - **Modify**: list.append(4)\n",
    "- **Filtering**: Use loops to extract items based on condition.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Keep only even numbers\n",
    "- **Useful for**: Data analysis, search features, dynamic displays\n",

    "---\n",

    "3. ## Random Number Generation & Simulations üé≤\n",
    "- **Random Numbers**: Used in games, simulations, security, and testing.\n",
    "  - **RANDOM(a, b)**: Gives a random integer between a and b (inclusive).\n",
    "  - Each run can give different results.\n",
    "  - **Examples**:\n",
    "    - Dice roll: random.randint(1, 6)\n",
    "    - Coin flip: random.randint(0, 1)\n",
    "- **Real-World Uses**:\n",
    "  - Games: dice, card shuffling, enemy behavior\n",
    "  - Simulations: weather, traffic\n",
    "  - Security: passwords, encryption keys\n",
    "- **Simulations**: Imitate real-world systems (don‚Äôt always need randomness).\n",
    "  - **Examples**:\n",
    "    - Traffic lights (fixed pattern)\n",
    "    - Bouncing ball (gravity and motion)\n",
    "    - Virus spread or weather (often include randomness)\n",

    "4. ## Big O and Algorithm Efficiency üßÆ\n",
    "- **Big O Notation**: Describes the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Common Big O Notations:\n",
    "- **O(1)**: Constant time ‚Äì performance doesn't change with input size.\n",
    "- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time ‚Äì grows slowly as input size increases (e.g., binary search).\n",
    "- **O(n)**: Linear time ‚Äì grows with the input size (e.g., loop through an array).\n",
    "- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time ‚Äì faster than quadratic, used in efficient sorts (e.g., merge sort).\n",
    "- **O(n¬≤)**: Quadratic time ‚Äì performance grows quickly with input size (e.g., bubble sort).\n",
    "- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time ‚Äì performance doubles with each input (e.g., naive Fibonacci).\n",
    "- **O(n!)**: Factorial time ‚Äì grows extremely fast (e.g., traveling salesman problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing Efficiency:\n",
    "- **Best Case**: Fastest time (ideal conditions).\n",
    "- **Worst Case**: Slowest time (largest input or worst conditions).\n",
    "- **Average Case**: Expected time for random input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- Big O helps compare algorithm performance.\n",
    "- **O(n log n)** is often better than **O(n¬≤)**, especially with large data sets.\n",

    "5. ## Graphs, Heuristics, and Undecidable Problems üìä\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphs\n",
    "- **Definition**: Graphs model relationships with nodes (vertices) and edges (connections).\n",
    "- **Complete Graph**: Every pair of vertices is connected by a single edge.\n",
    "- **Uses**: \n",
    "  - Pathfinding (e.g., Google Maps)\n",
    "  - Web ranking (e.g., PageRank)\n",
    "  - Network routing (e.g., data transfer)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjacency Matrix vs. Adjacency List\n",
    "- **Adjacency Matrix**: 2D array with 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs; represents connections between nodes.\n",
    "- **Adjacency List**: Array of linked lists; each list stores adjacent vertices of a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heuristics üß†\n",
    "- **Definition**: Approximate problem-solving methods when optimal solutions are too complex or costly.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - **Nearest Neighbor**: Used in Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) to pick the closest unvisited node.\n",
    "  - **Greedy Algorithms**: Choose the best immediate option, e.g., Coin Change problem.\n",
    "  - **Heuristic Search**: Helps in pathfinding with estimates like Manhattan or Euclidean distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Undecidable Problems ‚ùå\n",
    "- **Definition**: Problems that cannot be solved by any algorithm for all possible inputs (no guaranteed yes/no answer).\n",
    "- **Halting Problem**: Cannot predict if a program will stop or run forever.\n",
    "- **Decidable Problem**: Can always be solved by an algorithm (e.g., checking divisibility).\n",
    "- **Real-Life Analogy**: Predicting whether a friend will ever stop talking (you can't know for sure without listening).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "- **Undecidable**: Some problems cannot have a complete algorithmic solution.\n",
    "- **Decidable**: Problems with algorithms that provide a correct answer for all inputs.\n",
