    "**Best Strategies:**  \n",
    "✅ Use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0.  \n",
    "✅ Check if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these are the most efficient:**  \n",
    "Both methods are **O(1)** operations, meaning they run in constant time regardless of the size of the input. The modulus operator directly determines evenness, while checking the last digit is a quick shortcut for base-10 integers."

    "- The slicing method is implemented in C under the hood and operates in linear time **O(n)** with minimal overhead.  \n",
    "- It consistently outperforms the manual insert method in both **speed** and **memory efficiency**, especially as the string length increases.\n",
    "- The `memory_optimized_method` incurs high memory costs due to repeated insertions at the beginning of the list, making it significantly slower and more memory-intensive for large inputs."

This logarithmic growth makes it much more efficient as the size of the list increases.

Since Binary Search assumes that the list is sorted, it relies on dividing the list in half based on the assumption that the elements are ordered. If the list is unsorted, the algorithm may give incorrect results, as it could miss the target or incorrectly divide the list. To use Binary Search, the list must be sorted first, which would add the time complexity of sorting (**O(n log n)**) before performing the search."
