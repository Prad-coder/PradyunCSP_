    "- Chess feature against Stockfish is very interesting and unique\n",
    "- Game analysis feature where it gets the game right after you play Stockfish is very cool\n",
    "- Leaderboard feature is very aesthetic and polished\n",
    "- Chess feature is a little buggy, I can't enter my user ID because I can't type some characters\n",
    "- Analysis feature is also a little bit buggy or hard to understand how to use because I uploaded file and the analysis never started\n",
    "- AI Bot feature isn't working\n",
    "- Could add a feature that lets you play other people in the feature\n",

    "### Overall, great site, I really enjoyed playing chess on your site and analyzing some of the moves that I played!"
