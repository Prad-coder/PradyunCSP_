    "In 3.1, I learnt how to define variables and perform operations on variables defined as integers, as well as how to define a variable as a string. In 3.2, I learnt the different data types, which were integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and booleans, and how to define them and run operations on them. In 3.3, I learnt the different mathematical operations, and how to define variables as integers from user input in order to create a variable that performed an operation on the variable. In 3.4, I learnt how to perform string operations, through string concatenation. I also learnt how to analyze strings through creating functions that calculated the average word length, the number of vowels, and if the string was a palindrome or not. In 3.5, I learnt a more in depth lesson on booleans, and how to run functions to determine if something was true or false. In 3.6, I learnt if/else statements, and how to use them to run different operations on variables and test different things in python. In 3.7, I learnt how to use nested conditionals in if/else statements to further test something in python. I also learnt how to use pseudocode to plan out a code in python. In 3.8, I learnt how to use iterations such as loops and try/except statements. I learnt how to use try/except statements to ensure that the user was giving the desired input. In 3.10, I learnt how to create lists, as well as append, delete, change, and perform many operations on items in the list."
